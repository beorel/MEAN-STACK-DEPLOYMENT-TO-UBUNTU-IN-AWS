# MEAN-STACK-DEPLOYMENT-TO-UBUNTU-IN-AWS
NOTE: USE UBUNTU VERSION 20.04 IN ORDER NOT TO RUN INTO ERRORS, IF YOU ARE USING VERSION 22.04 UPWARDS YOU ARE LIKELY TO HAVE ERRORS OR UNSUPPORTED VERSION

MEAN Stack is a combination of the following components:
1. MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows retrieval of data.
2. Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
3. Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
4. Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user

**Preparing prerequisites**

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS, 20.04 LTS (HVM) image.

## Step 1: Install NodeJs
Update ubuntu
```
sudo apt update
```

Upgrade ubuntu
```
sudo apt upgrade
```

In this tutorial, we will explore three different ways of installing Node.js and npm on Ubuntu 20.04:
+ **From the "standard Ubuntu repositories".** This is the easiest way to install Node.js and npm on Ubuntu and should be sufficient for most use cases. The version included in the Ubuntu repositories is 10.19.0.
+ **From the "NodeSource repository."** Use this repository if you want to install a different Node.js version than the one provided in the Ubuntu repositories. Currently, NodeSource supports Node.js v14.x, v13.x, v12.x, and v10.x.
+ **Using "nvm (Node Version Manager)".** This tool allows you to have multiple Node.js versions installed on the same machine. If you are Node.js developer, then this is the preferred way of installing Node.js.

We are going to use NodeSource repository and Node Version Manager which is most preferable for the installation of MongoDB because The new minimum supported Node.js version is now 14.20.1

### Installing Node.Js Way 1
Installing Node.js and npm from NodeSource

NodeSource is a company focused on providing enterprise-grade Node support. It maintains an APT repository containing multiple Node.js versions. Use this repository if your application requires a specific version of Node.js.

At the time of writing, NodeSource repository provides the following versions:
+ v14.x - The latest stable version.
+ v13.x
+ v12.x - The latest LTS version.
+ v10.x - The previous LTS version.

We’ll install Node.js version 14.x:

Run the following command as a user with sudo privileges to download and execute the NodeSource installation script:
```
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
```

The script will add the NodeSource signing key to your system, create an apt repository file, install all necessary packages, and refresh the apt cache.

If you need another Node.js version, for example 12.x, change the setup_14.x with setup_12.x.

Once the NodeSource repository is enabled, install Node.js and npm:

```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

The nodejs package contains both the node and npm binaries.

Verify that the Node.js and npm were successfully installed by printing their versions:
```
node --version
```

`
Output
v14.21.3
`

```
npm --version
```

`
Output
6.14.18
`

To be able to compile native addons from npm you’ll need to install the development tools:
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Installing Node.Js Way 2
Installing Node.js and npm using NVM

NVM (Node Version Manager) is a bash script that allows you to manage multiple Node.js versions on a per-user basis. With NVM you can install and uninstall any Node.js version that you want to use or test.
Visit the [](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) copy either the curl or wget command to download and install the nvm script:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```


**NOTE: Do not use sudo while installing mongodb and other items as it will enable nvm for the root user 
e.g `sudo npm install body-parser` it might give an `error sudo command not found`, instead use  `npm install body-parser`**

The script will clone the project’s repository from Github to the ~/.nvm directory:

Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm

Once the script is in your PATH, verify that nvm was properly installed by typing:
```
nvm --version
```

`
Output
0.35.3
`

To get a list of all Node.js versions that can be installed with nvm, run:
```
nvm list-remote
```

The command will print a huge list of all available Node.js versions.

To install the latest available version of Node.js, run:
```
nvm install node
```

The output should look something like this:
![](https://github.com/beorel/MEAN-STACK-DEPLOYMENT-TO-UBUNTU-IN-AWS/blob/main/IMAGES/Screenshot%20(241).png)

Verify it by printing the Node.js version:
```
node --version
```
`
Output
v19.2.0
`

Let’s install two more versions, the latest LTS version and version 10.9.0:
```
nvm install --lts $ nvm install 10.9.0
```

You can list the installed Node.js versions by typing:
```
nvm ls
```
The output should look something like this:
![](https://github.com/beorel/MEAN-STACK-DEPLOYMENT-TO-UBUNTU-IN-AWS/blob/main/IMAGES/Screenshot%20(242).png)

The entry with an arrow on the right (> v10.9.0) is the Node.js version used in the current shell session and the default version is set to v19.2.0.
Default version is the version that will be active when opening new shells.


## Step 2: Install MongoDB
MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Fields in a database can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. For our example application, we are adding book records to MongoDB that contain book name, isbn number, author, and number of pages.

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list
```

Install MongoDB
```
sudo apt install -y mongodb
```

Start The server
```
sudo service mongodb start
```

Verify that the service is up and running
```
sudo systemctl status mongodb
```

You should see something like this:
![](https://github.com/beorel/MEAN-STACK-DEPLOYMENT-TO-UBUNTU-IN-AWS/blob/main/IMAGES/Screenshot%20(233).png)

Install body-parser package
```
sudo npm install body-parser
```

We need ‘body-parser’ package to help us process JSON files passed in requests to the server.

Create a folder named "Books"
```
mkdir Books && cd Books
```

In the Books directory, Initialize npm project
```
npm init
```

You should see something like this:
![](https://github.com/beorel/MEAN-STACK-DEPLOYMENT-TO-UBUNTU-IN-AWS/blob/main/IMAGES/Screenshot%20(234).png)

Add a file to it named server.js
```
vi server.js
```

Copy and paste the web server code below into the server.js file.
```
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var app = express();
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
require('./apps/routes')(app);
app.set('port', 3300);
app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
    console.log('Server up: http://localhost:' + app.get('port'));
});
```

## INSTALL EXPRESS AND SET UP ROUTES TO THE SERVER
Step 3: Install Express and set up routes to the server

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides features for web and mobile applications. We will use Express to pass book information to and from our MongoDB database.

We also will use Mongoose package which provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data. We will use Mongoose to establish a schema for the database to store data of our book register.
```
sudo npm install express mongoose
```

In ‘Books’ folder, create a folder named apps
```
mkdir apps && cd apps
```

Create a file named routes.js
```
vi routes.js
```

```
Copy and paste the code below into routes.js
var Book = require('./models/book');
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.get('/book', function(req, res) {
    Book.find({}, function(err, result) {
      if ( err ) throw err;
      res.json(result);
    });
  }); 
  app.post('/book', function(req, res) {
    var book = new Book( {
      name:req.body.name,
      isbn:req.body.isbn,
      author:req.body.author,
      pages:req.body.pages
    });
    book.save(function(err, result) {
      if ( err ) throw err;
      res.json( {
        message:"Successfully added book",
        book:result
      });
    });
  });
  app.delete("/book/:isbn", function(req, res) {
    Book.findOneAndRemove(req.query, function(err, result) {
      if ( err ) throw err;
      res.json( {
        message: "Successfully deleted the book",
        book: result
      });
    });
  });
  var path = require('path');
  app.get('*', function(req, res) {
    res.sendfile(path.join(__dirname + '/public', 'index.html'));
  });
};
```

In the ‘apps’ folder, create a folder named **models**
```
mkdir models && cd models
```

Create a file named book.js
```
vi book.js
```

Copy and paste the code below into ‘book.js’
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var dbHost = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test';
mongoose.connect(dbHost);
mongoose.connection;
mongoose.set('debug', true);
var bookSchema = mongoose.Schema( {
  name: String,
  isbn: {type: String, index: true},
  author: String,
  pages: Number
});
var Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
```

## Step 4 – Access the routes with AngularJS
AngularJS provides a web framework for creating dynamic views in your web applications. In this tutorial, we use AngularJS to connect our web page with Express and perform actions on our book register.

Change the directory back to ‘Books’

```
cd ../..
```

Create a folder named public
```
mkdir public && cd public
```

Add a file named script.js
```
vi script.js
```

Copy and paste the Code below (controller configuration defined) into the script.js file.
```
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
  $http( {
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/book'
  }).then(function successCallback(response) {
    $scope.books = response.data;
  }, function errorCallback(response) {
    console.log('Error: ' + response);
  });
  $scope.del_book = function(book) {
    $http( {
      method: 'DELETE',
      url: '/book/:isbn',
      params: {'isbn': book.isbn}
    }).then(function successCallback(response) {
      console.log(response);
    }, function errorCallback(response) {
      console.log('Error: ' + response);
    });
  };
  $scope.add_book = function() {
    var body = '{ "name": "' + $scope.Name + 
    '", "isbn": "' + $scope.Isbn +
    '", "author": "' + $scope.Author + 
    '", "pages": "' + $scope.Pages + '" }';
    $http({
      method: 'POST',
      url: '/book',
      data: body
    }).then(function successCallback(response) {
      console.log(response);
    }, function errorCallback(response) {
      console.log('Error: ' + response);
    });
  };
});
```

In the public folder, create a file named index.html;
```
vi index.html
```

Copy and paste the code below into index.html file.
```
<!doctype html>
<html ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
  <head>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Name:</td>
          <td><input type="text" ng-model="Name"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Isbn:</td>
          <td><input type="text" ng-model="Isbn"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Author:</td>
          <td><input type="text" ng-model="Author"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pages:</td>
          <td><input type="number" ng-model="Pages"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <button ng-click="add_book()">Add</button>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Isbn</th>
          <th>Author</th>
          <th>Pages</th>


        </tr>
        <tr ng-repeat="book in books">
          <td>{{book.name}}</td>
          <td>{{book.isbn}}</td>
          <td>{{book.author}}</td>
          <td>{{book.pages}}</td>


          <td><input type="button" value="Delete" data-ng-click="del_book(book)"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Change the directory back up to Books
```
cd ..
```

Start the server by running this command:
```
node server.js
```

You should see something like this:
![](https://github.com/beorel/MEAN-STACK-DEPLOYMENT-TO-UBUNTU-IN-AWS/blob/main/IMAGES/Screenshot%20(239).png)

The server is now up and running, we can connect it via port 3300. You can launch a separate Putty or SSH console to test what the curl command returns locally.

```
curl -s http://localhost:3300
```
It shall return an HTML page, it is hardly readable in the CLI, but we can also try and access it from the Internet.

For this – you need to open TCP port 3300 in your AWS Web Console for your EC2 Instance.

Now you can access our Book Register web application from the Internet with a browser using a Public IP address or Public DNS name.

This is how your Web Book Register Application will look like in browser:
